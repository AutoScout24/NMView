/**
 * This view has three different layouts defined in its nib file.
 *
 * For a layout to work correctly, the layout has to contain each of the
 * original layout's views in the exact same order in IB (order and hierarchy /
 * depth are both crucial). Once this setup is in place, you can re-position
 * the views (*not* change their order / depth) as you see fit. As the last
 * step, the type of the top level view which defines a layout needs to be
 * changed (in IB using the "Identity Inspector") to NMViewLayoutView to
 * indicate to NMView that it is indeed defining a layout. As an alternative,
 * you can also set the top level view's tag to a special value (see
 * NMViewLayout for the tag value).
 *
 * Overwrite the -layoutDidChangeToAspectRatio: method to perform some
 * post-processing of the views that cannot automatically happen in IB. As an
 * example, you can change the transform of a subview in
 * -layoutDidChangeToAspectRatio: to rotate it by 90Â°.
 *
 * Important notes:
 * (1) The basic view properties (like tag, auto-resizing properties and so on)
 *     of the subviews are loaded from the initial layout only. When changing to
 *     a different layout these properties will not change. Only the position
 *     and size of the subviews are adjusted during a layout change.
